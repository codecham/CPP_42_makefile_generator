# CPP_42_makefile_generator
Just a little makefile generator for the 42 CPP piscine 

To be able to run it everywhere you can:

1) Create a folder where you want.

2) Open and edit your shell configuration file. For exemple: vim ~/.zshrc

3) Add this line: export PATH="$PATH:*PATH_OF_YOUR_NEW_FOLDER*" 

(Replace *PATH_OF_YOUR_NEW_FOLDER* by the path of your new folder)

4) Do a make and place the file "gen_make_file" in your new created folder
